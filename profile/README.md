JavaScript is a high level programming language used both on the client-side 
and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML 
and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript 
gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

The history of JavaScript begins in 1995, when Brendan Eich designed the 
language for the Netscape Navigator in a record time of two weeks. JavaScript -
initially called Mocha and LiveScript - was inspired by Scheme, a multi-paradigm 
programming language created in the 1970's.

After Microsoft released its own version of JavaScript (jScript), Netscape 
submitted JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Associacion (ECMA),
with the goal of creating a unified standard for the language. This standard has
since been running under the name ECMAScript, which was adopted in version 6 in
2015 (ES6 or ES2015);

ECMAScript is a general purpose, cross platform, vendor-neutral programming 
language. The standard includes the language syntax, semantics, and 
libraries and complementary technologies that support the language
