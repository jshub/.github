JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in the world. From simple image sliders and dropdown menus to large-scale applications like Gmail and Netflix, JavaScript powers the interactive experiences we use every day.

Unlike HTML and CSS, which handle structure and style, JavaScript adds behavior by updating content, responding to user actions, and shaping the dynamic nature of the modern web.

What started as a quick prototype has grown into something used almost everywhere, supported by a global community and surrounded by a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. That reach and versatility have made JavaScript the backbone of the web and the starting point for countless developers.
