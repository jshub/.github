JavaScript is the worldâ€™s most widely used programming language, especially on the web. It powers everything from simple image sliders and dropdown menus to large-scale applications like Gmail and Netflix.

Unlike HTML and CSS, which handle structure and style, JavaScript brings pages to life by updating content, responding to user actions, and shaping the interactive feel of the modern web.

What started as a small prototype built by a single developer has grown into a language used almost everywhere, supported by a global community and surrounded by a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools. That reach and versatility have made JavaScript the backbone of the web, and the starting point for countless developers.
